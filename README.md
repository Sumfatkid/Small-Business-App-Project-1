# Small-Buisness-App-Project-1
Our small "buisness" project will be a bakery program that customers can use to easily create custom orders of their sweets; with a personal interaction by asking for their information.

Project 1 inquires us to use the knowlegde we've obtianed through the class and create our very own "buisiness-like" program. From using loops too drivers, it is a project that is challenging our skill to deliver an awesome bakery.

As far as changes go, I believe we have a program that was already fairly close to this goal. All we need to include is input lines of code that will store the user's information and repeat it back to them; it's that added level of a personal experience.
